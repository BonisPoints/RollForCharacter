    <h1>What is Dylan's Hero Picker?</h1>
    <p>This website is here to help you (and maybe some friends) pick what heroes to play as deciding has become a burden or you're just looking for a fun night.
        Whichever it may be, I'm here to help you on your way to this destination. Choose a game to select heroes from or maybe your loadout in the future.</p>
